    <p>2. Fetch can be used to connect to external files, like JSON and return the
        results of those data files into JavaScript code. The data needs time to load,
        that is why promises are used to handle the data once it's ready and
        returned from the endpoint. Using async and await in the function can set
        up the promise to wait until a response is returned. Fetch can do the same
        with the chaining of then promises to handle the data once its arrived. You
        can also use promiseAll if there are multiple files that need to load data into
        one object. Once all the data is ready then the file contents can be used in
        the code and output on the page.
        AJAX request example code exercise :
        1. Create 3 page buttons to make requests. Set up an element on the
        page to show the output of the results.
        2. Using the first button on click, connect to a json file and return the
        contents back using fetch. Output the results of the file onto the web
        page.
        3. The second button uses async on the main request function, and await
        to move to the next function once the request completes. Output the
        results of the file data into the web page.
        4. Create an array of the paths to several JSON files, with the same
        object structure in each file.
        5. Once the third button is pressed, use Promise.all to make fetch
        requests to each JSON file. Nest the map function within the
        Promise.all request, so that the code can iterate through each JSON
        file. Once all the requests are completed then output the content into
        the web page from the JSON files.</p>
